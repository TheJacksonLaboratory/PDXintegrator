PDXIntegrator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PDXIntegrator is inteded to provide a common semantic model for PDXNet. The project is currently in a preliminary
stage and we do not recommend use of any of this code in production environments. Instead this site is intended to
provide information about current plans for collaborators. Please visit https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/PDXintegrator
to view the current code base.

To get a very first impression of this project, we recommend that you go through the
:ref:`Demonstration of simulating cases and performing SPARQL queries <simulation>`.
